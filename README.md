## **Objective**
The Kanban Board Task Management App is designed to provide a seamless and intuitive way to organize tasks efficiently. It allows users to create, edit, delete, and reorder tasks within a **drag-and-drop interface**, ensuring real-time updates and persistence.

The application is built using **React (Vite.js) and Node.js (Express.js)**, with **MongoDB** for data storage and **Firebase Authentication** for secure user login.
